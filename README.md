Maybank NeXT Assessment 
----------------
To run my code, you need to have Flutter, Visual Studio Code and Android Studio installed on your PC, since I am using Flutter and Dart to develop the app. After opening the code on VS Code, you need to run 'flutter clean' and 'flutter pub get' on the terminal directed to the project's folder before running my code. Then, at the top menu of the VS Code, there is an option named 'Run', choose the menu and click 'Run Without Debugging'.

To have a better visualisation of my app, it is better to run my app on an Android device emulator since I designed the app based on a smartphone's screen. If you don't want to, it's okay, the code also can be run on Google Chrome, since Flutter is a cross platform mobile and web application framework. 

For the assessment, there are two bottom tabs on the application that I have developed. 1 tab is for Extension A and Extension C, and another tab is for Extension B. If you guys face any problem while running/test my code, please feel free to contact me at aaafr98@gmail.com.
